## Explanation of the YAML Configuration

This configuration defines a Gateway API setup using three resources: GatewayClass, Gateway, and HTTPRoute.

## 1. GatewayClass

```
kind: GatewayClass
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
metadata:
  name: my-controller
spec:
  controllerName: my.company.example.io/my-gateway-controller

```
Purpose: Specifies the controller responsible for managing Gateways in the cluster.
Key Fields:
name: The name of the GatewayClass (my-controller).
controllerName: Identifier for the custom Gateway controller.

## 2. Gateway

```
kind: Gateway
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
metadata:
  name: web-gateway
spec:
  gatewayClassName: my-controller
  listeners:
    - name: http
      protocol: HTTP
      port: 80
      allowedRoutes:
        namespaces:
          from: All

```
Purpose: Defines a Gateway instance listening for HTTP traffic on port 80.
Key Fields:
gatewayClassName: Links to my-controller (defined in GatewayClass).
listeners:
protocol: Specifies HTTP as the traffic type.
port: Listens on port 80.
allowedRoutes: Allows routes from all namespaces.

## 3. HTTPRoute
```
kind: HTTPRoute
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
metadata:
  name: httproute-basic
  labels:
    scenario: basic
spec:
  parentRefs:
    - group: gateway.networking.k8s.io
      kind: Gateway
      name: web-gateway
  hostnames:
    - "my.analytics.example.com"
  rules:
    - matches:
        - path:
            type: PathPrefix
            value: /data
      backendRefs:
        - name: data
          port: 8000
    - matches:
        - path:
            type: PathPrefix
            value: /visualize
      backendRefs:
        - name: visualize
          port: 9000

```
Purpose: Defines routing rules for HTTP traffic directed to specific application backends based on the path.

Key Fields:
parentRefs: Links to the web-gateway Gateway instance.
hostnames: Defines the hostname (my.analytics.example.com) for routing.
rules:
Match /data:
Routes traffic to the data Service on port 8000.
Match /visualize:
Routes traffic to the visualize Service on port 9000.

4. Pod for data Service

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: data-pod
  labels:
    app: data
spec:
  containers:
    - name: data-container
      image: nginx
      ports:
        - containerPort: 8000

```
Purpose: Defines a Pod serving the data backend.
Key Fields:
labels: The app: data label is used to link the Pod to the corresponding Service.
ports: Specifies the container port (8000).

5. Service for data Pod
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: data
spec:
  selector:
    app: data
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 8000
      targetPort: 8000
  type: ClusterIP

```
Purpose: Exposes the data Pod internally to the cluster.
Key Fields:
selector: Links to Pods with the label app: data.
ports: Maps Service port 8000 to Pod container port 8000.
type: Default type (ClusterIP), allowing internal cluster communication.


6. Pod for visualize Service

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: visualize-pod
  labels:
    app: visualize
spec:
  containers:
    - name: visualize-container
      image: nginx
      ports:
        - containerPort: 9000

```
Purpose: Defines a Pod serving the visualize backend.
Key Fields:
labels: The app: visualize label is used to link the Pod to the corresponding Service.
ports: Specifies the container port (9000).

7. Service for visualize Pod

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: visualize
spec:
  selector:
    app: visualize
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 9000
      targetPort: 9000
  type: ClusterIP

```
Purpose: Exposes the visualize Pod internally to the cluster.
Key Fields:
selector: Links to Pods with the label app: visualize.
ports: Maps Service port 9000 to Pod container port 9000.
type: Default type (ClusterIP), allowing internal cluster communication.

Full Workflow Summary

Ingress Traffic: The Gateway listens for HTTP traffic on port 80 for the hostname my.analytics.example.com.
Routing:
Requests with /data are routed to the data Service, which directs traffic to the data-pod on port 8000.
Requests with /visualize are routed to the visualize Service, which directs traffic to the visualize-pod on port 9000.
Separation of Concerns:
Gateway handles external traffic.
Services abstract the backend Pods and handle internal traffic.
Pods provide the actual application functionality.





Summary of Functionality

Traffic entering the cluster on my.analytics.example.com is handled by web-gateway:

Requests with path /data are routed to the data Service on port 8000.
Requests with path /visualize are routed to the visualize Service on port 9000.
This modular configuration separates control (GatewayClass), infrastructure (Gateway), and application-level routing (HTTPRoute), providing scalability and flexibility.
