Explanation of the YAML Configuration
This configuration defines a Gateway API setup using three resources: GatewayClass, Gateway, and HTTPRoute.

1. GatewayClass

```
kind: GatewayClass
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
metadata:
  name: my-controller
spec:
  controllerName: my.company.example.io/my-gateway-controller

```
Purpose: Specifies the controller responsible for managing Gateways in the cluster.
Key Fields:
name: The name of the GatewayClass (my-controller).
controllerName: Identifier for the custom Gateway controller.

2. Gateway

```
kind: Gateway
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
metadata:
  name: web-gateway
spec:
  gatewayClassName: my-controller
  listeners:
    - name: http
      protocol: HTTP
      port: 80
      allowedRoutes:
        namespaces:
          from: All

```
Purpose: Defines a Gateway instance listening for HTTP traffic on port 80.
Key Fields:
gatewayClassName: Links to my-controller (defined in GatewayClass).
listeners:
protocol: Specifies HTTP as the traffic type.
port: Listens on port 80.
allowedRoutes: Allows routes from all namespaces.

3. HTTPRoute
```
kind: HTTPRoute
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
metadata:
  name: httproute-basic
  labels:
    scenario: basic
spec:
  parentRefs:
    - group: gateway.networking.k8s.io
      kind: Gateway
      name: web-gateway
  hostnames:
    - "my.analytics.example.com"
  rules:
    - matches:
        - path:
            type: PathPrefix
            value: /data
      backendRefs:
        - name: data
          port: 8000
    - matches:
        - path:
            type: PathPrefix
            value: /visualize
      backendRefs:
        - name: visualize
          port: 9000

```
Purpose: Defines routing rules for HTTP traffic directed to specific application backends based on the path.
Key Fields:
parentRefs: Links to the web-gateway Gateway instance.
hostnames: Defines the hostname (my.analytics.example.com) for routing.
rules:
Match /data:
Routes traffic to the data Service on port 8000.
Match /visualize:
Routes traffic to the visualize Service on port 9000.

Summary of Functionality
Traffic entering the cluster on my.analytics.example.com is handled by web-gateway:
Requests with path /data are routed to the data Service on port 8000.
Requests with path /visualize are routed to the visualize Service on port 9000.
This modular configuration separates control (GatewayClass), infrastructure (Gateway), and application-level routing (HTTPRoute), providing scalability and flexibility.
